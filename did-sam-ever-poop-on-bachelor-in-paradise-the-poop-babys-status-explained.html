Today, we’re going to talk about childbirth – more specifically, poop childbirth.

Ushering in a brave new era in which these breech-birthed fecal darlings are treated with the pride and wet wipes they deserve, the reality series offered, for our consideration, the plight of Samantha “Sam” Jeffries, an occupational therapist from San Diego who couldn’t go to the bathroom, evocatively paired with footage of this turtle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/poop-turtle-final.png><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true>The stakes, as presented in the season’s teaser, could not have been higher. For nine days, we were told, Sam would experience – and this is a quote – “no pooping.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A medic arrived in an ambulance</a>, fully prepared to do what must be done. Safety was his number one concern. There was no number two.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>On Thursday, Oct. 12, Bachelor Nation finally arrived at the moment they’d been waiting for. Sam, as foretold in prophecy and in that sneak peek clip we were talking about, announced that she was nine days overdue for a deuce drop. Would she poop? Wouldn’t she? If not, would she eventually swell up like that kid from Willy Wonka after she ate forbidden gum? And if that was the case, what would her chiding Oompa Loompa song sound like? Please email us with your thoughts.</p><h2 id=h-the-bachelor-in-paradise-poop-baby-week-3-week-4-and-forever data-injectable=false>The Bachelor in Paradise poop baby: Week 3, week 4, and forever</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sam-and-Jesse-Bachelor-in-Paradise.png><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=841 data-injectable=true>It is an unfortunate fact that Sam did not pass her poop baby during episode 3 of Bachelor in Paradise. But around the corner from where the fudge wasn’t made, she took life’s lemons and made lemonade, parlaying her condition into a romantic, high-fiber dinner and bowel-loosening exercise routine with fellow Paradise-dweller Aaron. On a show so frequently focused on the shallow and exciting aspects of romance, it was almost heartwarming to see a duo connecting over life’s more horrendous little moments. Love really is disgusting.</p><p data-characters=955 data-current-count=955 data-injectable=true>Episode 4 of Bachelor in Paradise carried us into a dark and dystopian future. On the morning of day 10, before the sun that belongs to no man had peeked up over that unattainable horizon, Sam looked upon the works of the universe – each grain of sand its own unknowable miracle – and continued to not take a dump. Robbed of her chance to raise a poo baby to feculent adolescence, presumably using her BiP earnings to send it to a respectable pooniversity, Sam left Paradise, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesse Palmer</a> announcing during the evening’s rose ceremony that there was “still no movement.” Who knows what adventures awaited her on the other side of tomorrow? A life spent spiraling into an ever more consuming sense of dread every time she hears a stranger say “Hey, you’re that poo girl?” Probably. You get what you get when you tell the producers of a reality show that you haven’t unloosed the caboose in a week.</p><p data-characters=594 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=false>Parties interested in the nightmares lying in the human digestive system are encouraged to check out Philadelphia’s historic Mutter Museum, which proudly displays <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal horrors beyond your comprehension</a>. Meanwhile, in a bellwether for the state of television in general, Sam’s poop journey is set to continue into a second episode next week. The fact that there have been no news reports of a California woman on an island exploding recently hints at a happy outcome. On a side note, I just started watching Bachelor shows this year and I’m not mad at America, but I am disappointed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yltcNmqpqlXZrDpr6MqaaoqF2ku26uwJyfnqSfp3qquoypmKuZlJ7ApnnToZxmqJ%2BkvW6uwJuwrGWjqa61wdJmnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
