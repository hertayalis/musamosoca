Cole shared some encouraging news about O’Reilly’s condition and expressed hope for his return to the wrestling scene.</p><p>According to Cole, O’Reilly is doing well and maintaining a positive outlook. He stated that O’Reilly is on the right track and is eager to come back to work, especially now that their former colleague Roderick Strong has joined AEW.</p><p>Cole also praised O’Reilly’s toughness, describing him as one of the toughest individuals he has ever met. He expressed his optimism for O’Reilly’s progress and expressed his hope that fans will see him back in action very soon.</p><p>“He’s doing good. He’s in good spirits, he’s on the right track. There is nothing that Kyle wants to do more than come back to work, especially now that Roderick Strong is here and things like that. Again, he is one of the toughest guys I’ve ever met for sure. Everyone keep your fingers and toes crossed, Kyle’s doing awesome, he’s seeing great great progress and hopefully we’ll see him very very soon.”</p><p>Fans have long anticipated a potential reunion of the Undisputed Era faction, particularly with the recent signing of Roderick Strong. However, injuries to Cole and O’Reilly, coupled with the departure of Bobby Fish, had cast doubt on the possibility. Nevertheless, with Cole’s return and O’Reilly’s ongoing recovery, there may be hope for the group’s reunion in 2023.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What are your thoughts on Adam Cole’s update about Kyle O’Reilly’s condition and his potential return to the wrestling scene?
