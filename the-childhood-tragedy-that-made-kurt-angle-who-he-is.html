As A.R. Schaefer's book&nbsp;<a href=#>Olympic Hero:&nbsp;Pro Wrestler Kurt Angle</a> tells us, Angle's father, David, was his most ardent supporter. David always made a point of attending his son's athletic events, and was fond of telling people that young Kurt was the greatest athletic talent in the family.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, in August 1985 the supportive father lost his life in a tragic accident. As Angle's autobiography (via <a href=#>ABC News</a>)&nbsp;tells us, David, a construction worker, fell from his crane, plummeting 15 feet and landing on his head. His skull cracked in three places, and he broke both of his shoulders. In a move that goes a long way toward explaining his son's later "with a broken neck"&nbsp;work ethic, he nevertheless walked to a hospital with his own two legs. Sadly, he fell in a coma just hours later. After the family was informed he was never going to wake up, they decided to turn off his life support two days after the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Angle himself, this was&nbsp;the&nbsp;most formative experience of his life.&nbsp;"If I had to point to one crucial turning point in my life that was it," Angle has stated. "I grew up and overcame my fears the day he died. I vowed right then and there to become a champion, to do whatever it took."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bk2xpbWpfqbWmecKhoKWcmKS8pXnTq5ignZSuerW0wK1kppmUmnqswdGtZJqml6GybsPHqGShnV2ewHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
