 Toto - Africa. Picture: Columbia   By Tom Eames   Toto's 1982 smash 'Africa' is without doubt one of the greatest songs of all time, let alone the 1980s.
It's almost impossible to not burst into song at the top of your lungs as soon as you hear that famous catchy intro.
And that chorus? &#34;I bless the rains down in Africaaaaa&#34;. Incredible.
But did you know its fascinating backstory?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was like God channeling it. I thought, 'I'm talented, but I'm not that talented.

It had a lasting impact on him: "It both moved and appalled me, and the pictures just wouldn't leave my head. I tried to imagine how I'd feel about it if I was there and what I'd do."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Jeff Porcaro added: "A white boy is trying to write a song on Africa, but since he's never been there, he can only tell what he's seen on TV or remembers in the past."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Further lyrics are about a person flying in to meet a lonely missionary, as Paich explained in 2018. As a child, he attended a Catholic school, and several of his teachers had done missionary work in Africa.</p><p class=paragraph-text>At the time, Paich had never set foot in Africa, and based the song's landscape descriptions from an article in National Geographic.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=10><h2 class=title>It almost didn't make the album at all</h2><p class=paragraph-text>Steve Porcaro and Steve Lukather once described the song as "dumb" and "an experiment", and that some of the lyrics were "goofy", particularly the line about the Serengeti.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Steve Porcaro said it was the last song they recorded and it barely made the cut for the album.</p><p class=paragraph-text>At one stage, Jeff Porcaro considered saving 'Africa' for a solo album as other members didn't think it sounded like a Toto song.
