Just pick one of the three listed above and you’ll have no issues.</p><p>Jhala is a good choice for skilled players – she has high damage, but low defence. As for her involvement on Thera – she used to lead the armies of the entire land against the Zombie Lord Ehzot. Got a fancy title from Apollo for it, as well. So she’s a famous commander – that clasifies her as a legend alright.</p><p>Sidra might be a better choice if you’re new to the game – she has higher defence, allowing you to survive attacks more easily. Also, she’s a pirate queen. Can’t really beat that. After getting to Valhalla, she promptly stole a ship and resumed her pirating duties in the other world as well. It’s literally one of the reasons why Odin created the tournament in the first place.</p><p>Xull is interesting because he has the highest attack of all the legends, but lacks in pretty much every other category. He might be the best choice for highly skilled players, as well as those who like to rush in blindly and hope for the best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvSrqWop5JjsLC5jqCsopyVqHyjvsCwo6GZnKGubrjEoJynnKNis7O7zGaroZ2ilnq4scSko7JlnZ7AtLXOp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
