Gus considered Jesse to be too much of a high-risk for his secretive drug empire. Walt eventually convinced Gus to hire him, though Gus insisted that Walt work with trusted chemist Gale Boetticher rather than Jesse, to which Walt agreed.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Walt and Jesse’s “Blue Sky” meth recipe was nearly perfect, maintaning a high quality and constantly satisfying customers. This undoubtedly pleased Gus, which resulted in him — and Walt and Jesse — becoming insanely wealthy in the process.</p><h2 id=h-so-why-did-gus-want-to-kill-walt data-injectable=false>So, why did Gus want to kill Walt?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gus-walt.jpg><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Over time, the relationship between Walt and Gus deteriorated significantly. Walt organized the murder of Gale, had a brother-in-law in the DEA, and was far too intelligent and arrogant for his own good. In simpler terms, Walt and Gus were far too alike in regards to both individuals wanting to be the boss and in total control.</p><p data-characters=598 data-current-count=928 data-injectable=true>Both men were aware of their own greatness and both believed that they deserved to be in charge, and simply put, each would do absolutely anything to prove it to the other. As a result, Gus saw this as a real threat, considering Walt always had Jesse by his side, whereas Gus could never fully convince Jesse to betray Walt despite his constant efforts. Of course, the season 3 finale, “Full Measure,” was the perfect indication of this, with Walter forcing Jesse to shoot and kill Gale Boetticher — who was dangerously close to replacing Walt as Gus’ leading meth manufacturer.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>Walt eventually became an extreme risk to Gus’ drug operation, seeing as Hank Schrader was beginning to ask too many questions and catching on to Gus’ suspicious activity, as seen in the “Crawl Space” episode. Additionally, Walt’s ego began to grow while under Gus’ control, and Gus knew that Walt would eventually become just as unpredictable and untrustworthy as Jesse initially was.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>At first, Gus fired Walt and ordered him to stay away from the lab, proclaiming that Jesse would be in charge of the cooking. However, Jesse was extremely loyal to Walt and wouldn’t cook without him. Thus, Gus hatched a plan to kill Walt, though Walt ultimately beat him to the punch in “Face Off.” Damn, what a show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmm6ido2K0tr%2BMsJinrF2pvG63yKWjZq%2BRocGmvoyipWaaopqurLXNoGSbmZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
