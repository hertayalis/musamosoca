In Episode 41, viewers are introduced to <a href=#>Nyhjee and Cianna</a>, two star-crossed lovers who are separated by distance. Here’s what we know about them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meet Nyhjee and Cianna from ‘Catfish.’</h2><p>Nyhjee is a comedian and former HVAC technician from Philadelphia, Pa., who may have finally found love with an 18-year-old Instagrammer named Cianna. The problem is they’re 100 miles apart. According to Nyhjee, he frequently forks over cash to his online lover due to her ongoing financial problems. But per the usual, Kamie and Nev aren’t buying anything that this potential catfish is selling.</p><p>Especially given the fact that Nyhjee traveled all the way to Delaware by train in February of 2020 only to be stood up by Cianna with no explanation. After waiting for three hours and returning home, Cianna finally reached out and insisted that her absence was the result of an urgent family crisis. Yeah, right.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Still, Nyhjee was enamored by the thought of finally meeting his online lover and refuses to give up hope, even though she refuses to FaceTime him. Nyhjee said that their inconsistent communication gave him more than enough reason to cut his relationship with Cianna short, but he still refers to her as his “wife for life."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a clip for the June 29 episode of Catfish, Kamie seems to have reason to believe that Cianna may be dating other people, which is a blow to Nyhjee, who has been communicating with his long-distance lover for more than two years. He says in a clip, “I feel like I’m getting used or played. And I hate that feeling.”</p><p>But will their imaginary matrimony remain intact if Nhyjee discovers that Cianna isn't who she claims to be?

Cianna was really Cianna, and she claims that being only 18, her overprotective mom wouldn't let her FaceTime with guys (though viewers think that Cianna being white and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nhyjee being Black</a> might be why her mom really wouldn't let her).</p><p>In the end, the potential couple might have had a shot — but Nhyjee revealing that he was intimate with other women while talking to Cianna could be the dealbreaker.</p><p>New episodes of Catfish air Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJyhkaO7onnOp2ScmaSbtrS0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
