You may have noticed that I love roasted sweet potatoes in just about any salad (as evident here,&nbsp;here, and here) but this combination – with roasted tomatoes, roasted apples, corn, and a tangy/smoky chipotle dressing – was so good that I made it for dinner two nights in a row. The first night, I made this as&nbsp;a lazy-girl dinner. Jack was out of town so&nbsp;for an easy “by myself” dinner I decided&nbsp;to roast&nbsp;the things (pictured above) that had just arrived&nbsp;in my&nbsp;Farmhouse Delivery…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Three things I am obsessed with: chickpeas, avocado, and all things&nbsp;MINI… mini pizzas, mini tacos, mini pies, mini skillets. I had these cute little pretzel buns last week so&nbsp;that’s how this recipe started. (Although you could use any kind of bun or sliced bread for this recipe). I first thought of making little veggie burgers, but since it’s a whopping 103 degrees(!) outside, I’ve been trying to use my oven as little as possible. Plus this chickpea salad is fast, easy, and cold,&nbsp;which is everything I want in a summer recipe. These&nbsp;would be perfect for a summer picnic&nbsp;except, well, it’s…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy August! I hope corn is in season where you are, because I have&nbsp;a pretty corny tostada recipe today. Let’s just say that I decided to go for the corn trifecta. I started by making&nbsp;some sweet and smoky corn hummus&nbsp;that is a great snack on its own. Then I slathered it onto crispy (baked) corn tortillas.&nbsp;Finally, I topped these with avocado and MORE&nbsp;grilled corn because, well, I was up to my ears in fresh summer corn, and I had to use it somehow. After spending the month of July eating pasta, I feel like a I needed a Texas re-tox.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Ciao from Italia! At the moment, our life is all about pizza, pasta and tomatoes. It’s amazing but every time I travel, the things I miss&nbsp;most are tacos and mexican-ish food.&nbsp;We made these quesadillas a few weeks ago but I could totally go for one right now! I often get questions about how to cook eggplant. My favorite and most foolproof method for&nbsp;non-spongy eggplant is to grill it. (If you don’t have an outdoor grill, you can use a grill pan on your stove). I grill mine&nbsp;simply with olive oil, salt and pepper, and a squeeze of lemon or drizzle…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Jack here, writing for the blog today while Jeanine writes for the book… I have something to admit that I’m having a hard time with. I’m starting to prefer vegan “mac and cheese”&nbsp;to actual mac and cheese. Now, this is a hard one for me. You see, I love cheese. Almost every time we go to Whole Foods, I raid the “under $3 cheese” bin to find crazy new cheeses that I can barely pronounce. And a great grilled cheese is work of art. But these vegan “mac and cheese” recipes Jeanine comes up with pretty much hit everything I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s hard for me to pick favorites, but I’ll come out and say it: this vegan corn chowder recipe is one of my favorite soups on the blog. I don’t care what temperature it might be outside – I could eat a bowl of this creamy, smoky corn chowder anytime. Vegan Corn Chowder Recipe Ingredients This vegan corn chowder recipe uses veggies and spices to get a delicious creamy texture and smoky flavor without any meat or dairy. Here’s what’s in it: Onion, garlic, and celery make up its aromatic base. Sweet corn is the star of the show! It…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>For years, I had a very routine&nbsp;“breakfast” that I&nbsp;would pick&nbsp;up on my way to work: a double tall soy latte at 110 degrees. (I know, I was one of those coffee-orderers). These days,&nbsp;I’ve swapped my beverage breakfast for a real one, my expensive coffee for tea, and my soy milk for almond milk. Although I now work from home, I still love to get a quick start in the morning. Which is why I’m so excited about this recipe –&nbsp;this&nbsp;latte is SO simple and is made up of ingredients from my spice drawer which makes me wonder how I ever…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>And soup season continues! It might not be snowing here, but the fact that it’s been 80 degrees outside doesn’t stop me from craving big pots of stewy vegetables. Plus I just love having the&nbsp;leftovers around for lunch all week. They get better on the second day, and even better on the third day. This stew has pretty much all of my favorites: hearty butternut squash, quinoa & kale. It all gets simmered&nbsp;in a stewy tomato broth. It’s a pretty simple recipe that you should spice up as much as you like. I used cumin, coriander & smoked paprika, but…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be all about fancy cooking and elaborate meals. If pasta making sounds too stressful, try this cozy one-pot stew that’s perfect&nbsp;for two. (With maybe a little leftover, if you eat less than we do). It doesn’t get much easier than this – sauté leeks and mushrooms in an oven-safe pot or this adorable heart shaped one.&nbsp;Add tomatoes, chickpeas, couscous and – the fancy part – a&nbsp;few pinches of saffron. Yes, saffron is expensive but a little goes a long way. Plus, it’s Valentine’s Day&nbsp;so let’s live a little. Pop it in the oven and bake…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I made a half batch of these cookies, which was clearly a mistake. I ate the last one for breakfast this morning&nbsp;and I could really go for another one right about now. Chewy, oaty, nutty… slightly sweet and warmly spiced… it’s the kind of cookie&nbsp;that’s just healthy enough to get by as breakfast but would be even more&nbsp;perfect as a 2pm snack. If only… This recipe is just slightly adapted&nbsp;from Amy Chaplin’s book At Home in the Whole Food Kitchen, which is hands down one of&nbsp;the most beautiful cookbooks I’ve ever held. I’ve been a fan of Amy’s for the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I can hardly believe it’s November already. Of course that’s because generally&nbsp;it’s warm and sunny&nbsp;here in Austin.&nbsp;Just last week&nbsp;I was trying to explain to my mom (in Chicago) how 80 degrees can indeed feel like fall to us. While we might not have extreme season changes,&nbsp;winter produce is slowly starting to show up. Pears, Pomegranates… I’ll take them all. Today, I’m sharing a few more of my favorite easy&nbsp;ideas for pairing fresh produce with McCormick’s Gourmet Spices. Mushrooms:&nbsp;To me, nothing is more comforting (yet healthy) in the wintertime than mushrooms. We just love&nbsp;cremini mushrooms in&nbsp;hearty soups.
