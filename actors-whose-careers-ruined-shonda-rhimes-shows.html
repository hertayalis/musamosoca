The aftermath of her Grey's Anatomy departure made her feel like her own career had "betrayed her," leaving her "traumatized." She ventured into therapy for the first time in her life. That's understandable, considering how Rhimes continued trash-talking Heigl for years after the fracas.</p><p>Discussing the comparably harmonious Scandal cast with <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2014, Rhimes blithely invoked Heigl's name as shorthand for "troublesome talent," saying, "There are no Heigls in this situation ... I don't put up with bulls**t or nasty people. I don't have time for it." Rhimes chalked up the philosophy to her newly-minted "No A**hole Policy."&nbsp;</p><p>That statement messed with Heigl's head in a big way. "It sucks," she told <a href=#>Extra</a>'s Mario Lopez. "I'm sorry she's left with such a crappy impression of me. I wish I could do something to change that. Maybe I will be able to someday."&nbsp;</p><p>Alas, Heigl's recent acting won't go far in repairing Rhimes' impression (or anyone else's, for that matter.) In 2016, Heigl returned to the public eye to shill a kitty litter brand called Cat's Pride. She stars in a series of&nbsp;television commercials&nbsp;in which she assumes the role of an uppity cat therapist, crisply spouting lines such as: "Why did you dookie on Derek's pillow?" (Spoken to a shell-shocked cat, of course.)</p><p>Suffice to say, Heigl's career is now a long way from Grey Sloan&nbsp;Memorial Hospital. She needs a better opportunity, right meow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlkZ4Fye8Ccq6iqo2LEqbvSnmScmaKasrO%2FjKusoqaVmXq0tM6nm5plop22rrHSZqqhp6eofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
