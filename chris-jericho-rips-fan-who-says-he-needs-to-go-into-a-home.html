Jericho has never failed to put over talent such as MJF, Orange Cassidy, Action Andretti and more. He even lost to all of the above talent and more in order to establish them.</p><p>The former AEW World Champion has also developed quite a reputation in the past couple of years, as many fans feel he has become on edge and resorts to childish attacks in response to criticism.</p><p>A fan took to Twitter and stated that Chris Jericho needs to go into a home. Chris Jericho saw the fan’s tweet and clearly didn’t too kindly to what the fan said, as he replied in an expected way.</p><p>Agreed! I’ll go into YOUR home and spend some quality time with yer mum…</p><p>Chris Jericho and Sting also had a major confrontation on this week’s episode of AEW Dynamite.
