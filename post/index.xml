That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store

Just to stay between the shoresAnd I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky</description></item><item><title>Funniest Anya reactions on Spy x Family</title><link>/funniest-anya-reactions-on-spy-x-family.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/funniest-anya-reactions-on-spy-x-family.html</guid><description>Season one of Spy x Family was a huge success for Crunchyroll in 2022, quickly emerging as one of the streaming service’s best anime of the year.
