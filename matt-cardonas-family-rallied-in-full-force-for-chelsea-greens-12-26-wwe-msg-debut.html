However, she has made a successful return and is now a prominent figure on WWE television, even capturing a championship for some time. Green marked her Madison Square Garden debut during the December 26th WWE Live Event. Notably, Matt Cardonaâ€™s family showed up at the event to support Green for her debut, adding a personal touch to this significant moment in her career.</p><p>As seen on last weekâ€™s episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>Monday Night RAW</a>, Chelsea Green and Pipe Niven defended their WWE Womenâ€™s Tag Team Titles against Kayden Carter and Katana Chance. They ended up losing <a href=#>the titles and shocked fans all over the world</a>.</p><p>This led to her starting yet <a href=#>another #JusiceForChelsea campaign</a>. That carried forward during the December 26th WWE Live Event at Madison Square Garden, where she and Piper Nivel challenged Kayden Carter and Katana for the WWE Womenâ€™s Tag Team Titles. Unsurprisingly, Green and Niven were unable to reclaim the titles despite their best efforts.</p><p>Following the conclusion of the historic Madison Square Garden event, Chelsea Green took to Twitter and revealed that her husband Matt Cardonaâ€™s entire family made their way to the event to give Green support, as it was her debut at the Worldâ€™s Most Famous Arena.</p><p>â€˜â€˜ðŸ’™ðŸ©·ðŸ’™ðŸ©· The Cardonaâ€™s came to support me at my @WWE msg debut!â€™â€˜</p><p>Last nightâ€™s event also ended up <a href=#>breaking records for WWE at Madison Square Garden</a>. Only time will tell whether Chelsea Green will become a champion again, but she will always have the support of her family and thatâ€™s what truly matters to her now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you make of this wholesome post concerning Chelsea Green?
