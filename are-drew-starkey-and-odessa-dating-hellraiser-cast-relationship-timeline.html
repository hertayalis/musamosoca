Additionally, their attractiveness does not harm us. Given that they are successful and attractive, it is only reasonable for followers to assume that they are seeing or dating someone. Starkey and A’zion, however, choose to keep their personal connections under wraps as is common for performers.</p><p>It is difficult to determine who the Hellraiser cast is dating right now since they have done a good job of hiding their romantic relationships. However, due to their lovely relationship and frequent public appearances together, many people believe that Odessa and Drew have recently started dating.</p><p>On Drew’s birthday in November 2022, Odessa also shared some nice photos of the two of them, but it appears that they are close friends. Additionally, it was more clear for followers to think that they were dating because of the cute and intimate photos Odessa uploaded of the pair.</p><p>However, neither party has publicly acknowledged or denied their relationship, and they appear to be more like friends than lovers.
