He chose a counseling program over jailtime and promised to change: "I want to be happy again, and I'm going to do something about it before it kills me or f***s up everything in my life." But that was not the end of Weiland's self-destructive behavior, barely surviving a heroin overdose in 1999 and being arrested for domestic battery in 2001. And in 2003, conflicts between Weiland and the other STP members had escalated so badly, the band broke up.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2008, STP got back together, and everything seemed well for a few years — at least until rumors of STP firing Weiland started spreading. In 2013, these were confirmed, as STP members claimed Weiland didn't show up for shows or was late on a number of occasions, and was utilizing the band's fame for his own gains, thus disrupting their efforts for a 20th anniversary tour (via <a href=#>USA Today</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>Weiland sued back, and tensions between the band members were at an all-time high. Tragically, Weiland died from a cocaine overdose in December 2015, leaving STP members grief-stricken and filled with regrets over not making peace in time. As <a href=#>The San Diego Union-Tribute</a> notes, Dean DeLeo's STP song "Finest Hour" includes the line, "You never said goodbye."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCElWlnbmhfqbWmecGinqCdo6l6tK%2FAp5uapKNiwbB5xK%2Bcq2WYnsFus9GupaCdXaLCtLXCaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
