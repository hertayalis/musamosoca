The Plasmatics fielded several LPs with titles like "New Hope for the Wretched" and "Beyond the Valley of 1984," but their gonzo live shows were the band's focus — and they were so completely, consistently off the rails that on the one hand, they were banned from performing in Britain, and on the other, they sold out New York's legendary Palladium without a major record contract, something no other band had ever done.&nbsp;</p><p>In the late '80s, Williams continued with a solo project produced by Gene Simmons of KISS, one final Plasmatics record entitled "Maggots:&nbsp;The Record," and even a rap-themed album, before retiring in 1988. A decade later, at the home she shared with former manager and partner Rod Swenson, she died by suicide; Swenson indicated that she had long had difficulty adjusting to life outside of music, and that she had planned her death for some time (via <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>). Williams was 48 years old.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.
