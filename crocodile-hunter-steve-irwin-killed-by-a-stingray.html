Iconic Aussie wildlife daredevil Steve Irwin has died as he loved living: seeking out the world’s most dangerous and exotic creatures in their own domain."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Stingrays are considered safe and almost tame, and it’s ironic that one killed a man so well known for grappling with fiercer animals.</p><p>Here are some pictures I took of stingrays while swimming with them and feeding them. They’re not thought of as dangerous at all, and cruise excursions usually offer a “swim with the stingrays” outing.</p><p>Whatever your opinion of this guy, it’s sad that he leaves behind a family. I still can’t imagine him getting killed by a stingray of all things.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.photobucket.com/albums/f123/katiezo/augustb/stingrays1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.photobucket.com/albums/f123/katiezo/augustb/stingrays2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmam5haHykvs6cpp2hnJqsqcHNrZyrl6OpsrexvqKpsKGelLiquMuem5iaqZSuoL%2FToqWgqpGufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
