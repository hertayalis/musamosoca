So, to make Chains of Honor armor you need to add a Dol rune, an Um rune, a Ber rune, and then an Ist rune to a set of 4-socket body armor. Remember, the base armor has to have exactly four sockets, and you have to add the runes in exactly that order.
The most basic form of body armor that can have as many as four sockets is Gothic Armor."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Remember, the base armor has to have exactly four sockets, and you have to add the runes in exactly that order.</p><p data-injection=true>The most basic form of body armor that can have as many as four sockets is Gothic Armor. If you’re lucky, you might find a set of 4-socket Gothic Armor during Act V on Normal difficulty but that, or any other set of 4-socket armor, is much more likely to show up on Nightmare or Hell difficulty. As always, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Cow Level</a> is the best place to grind and farm.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Sorceress build in Diablo 2: Resurrected</a></p><p data-injection=true>To get all those runes though, you’re mostly going to have to play on higher difficulty levels. The Dol rune you might actually get during Act V on Normal difficulty. If not, farm it from The Countess or the Hellforge on Nightmare. You can also get the Um rune on Nightmare difficulty, during Act IV or later, or from the Hellforge. And the Ist rune sometimes drops during Act V on Nightmare difficulty but is much more common on Hell difficulty. The Ber rune is the rarest in this runeword recipe though. You can only get it during Act III or later on Hell difficulty, and it never drops from The Countess or the Hellforge on any difficulty.</p><p>Once you’ve been through Hell and collected the necessary ingredients, you’ll be able to make one of the best all-around body armors in the game.
