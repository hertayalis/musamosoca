Warner Bros. seems extremely keen on relaunching the brand across the board, as he’ll have a cameo in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the upcoming&nbsp;</a>Space Jam 2 and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a new movie</a> is also said to be in development. What’s more, the Mask could be getting his own TV show, too.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>According to sources close to WGTC – the same ones who told us about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the&nbsp;Space Jam 2&nbsp;return</a>, before leaked images and videos confirmed it – WB is working on a Mask animated series for HBO Max. What’s more, Jim Carrey may return to provide the voice of Stanley Ipkiss/his super-powered alter ego. Plot details are still unknown, but it’s said to be aimed at an adult audience.</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>Those who grew up in the 90s might remember the old cartoon show that spun out of the hit 1994 movie. In keeping with the film’s cartoon antics, this was a very family-friendly series that featured Rob Paulsen taking over Carrey’s role. In contrast, this HBO Max project sounds like it would go back to the much more mature Dark Horse comics that birthed the character. We’re even hearing that it’ll be pitched in a similar vein to DC Universe’s Harley Quinn.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/157396469790243764-6.jpeg alt="The Mask" width=1000 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>A tone similar to the Kaley Cuoco-fronted series would definitely be right for&nbsp;The Mask,&nbsp;as it could marry the wild humor of the movie with all the violence and strong language an R-rating would allow, again similar to the original comics. As for whether Carrey would sign up for such a project, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he did recently state</a> that he’d play the part again if it was taken in a bold new direction, and this would surely fit that bill.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Obviously, this is just at the early development stage right now so anything could happen as things continue to progress, but it’s definitely sounding like<strong> The Mask</strong> is about to make his mark on our screens once again.
