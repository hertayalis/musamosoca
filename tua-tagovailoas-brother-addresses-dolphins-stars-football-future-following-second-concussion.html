Despite the injury, he appeared normal and played the entire game. But the next day, Tua was added to the NFL’s concussion protocol, which shocked everyone in the NFL. Later, coach Mike McDaniel confirms that he is hurt and won’t play against the New England Patriots in the next game.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>if this play at 2:40 was Tua's concussion, here are his stats:</p><p>pre-concussion: 9/12, 229 yds, 19.1 YPA, 1 TD, 0 INT</p><p>post-concussion: 7/13, 81 yds, 6.2 YPA, 0 TD, 3 INTs<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0FvirTtxnR</a></p><p>— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 26, 2022</a></p><p>Previously, <a href=#>he suffered the same kind of concussion twice in back-to-back matches in September</a>. The NFL and players association launched an investigation, which resulted in the firing of the doctor who cleared him of a concussion. These repetitious incidents raise a cautionary note in the NFL community.</p><h2>What did his younger brother say?</h2><p>In the context, Taulia Tagovailoa, the younger brother of Tua, expressed his disappointment. “Everyone has their opinion. My brother, I know he works hard. I know he has a family now. I want my brother to be safe, but at the same time I know that he has a love and a passion for football. I feel like he is going to make the right decision. The biggest thing is staying safe, so that is something he has to pray on. I know when it comes down to it, he will make the right decision,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Taulia told Tim Reynolds of the AP</a>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportszion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/USATSI_19115589_168386351_lowres-scaled-e1664905255445-1.jpg alt="Tua Tagovailoa ijury" width=1200 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-pagespeed-url-hash=1653529901 onload=pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The main concern is whether the 24-year-old quarterback will be able to play this season. Though, <a href=# rel=noopener>there are many former professionals and legends who urge the NFL not to let Tua play in this circumstance</a>. Taulia, the QB of the Maryland Terrapins, also shared his thoughts regarding the matter, saying, “I just feel like he’s not going to stop playing football. I feel like every opportunity he has, he is going to try to play. I don’t know, it’s just ‘go until the wheels fall off.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=# rel=noopener>@SteveYoungQB</a> is looking for a change in culture around football with Tua Tagovailoa returning to the concussion protocol:</p><p>"It creates an environment where you're going to play hurt." <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8KDVU4dSGO</a></p><p>— NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 26, 2022</a></p><p>After Tua’s incidents, <a href=#>the NFL and NFLPA unified on modified rules regarding concussion protocol</a>, stating any player who shows possible concussion symptoms—including a lack of balance or stability—to sit out the remainder of a game. Thus, <a href=#>the athletes can get a guarantee of health, safety, and security</a>.</p><p>The NFL world doesn’t want to see another youngster fall victim to injuries. He still has a lot to give on that 100 yard pitch. We at SportsZion are praying for Tua Tagovailoa’s speedy and healthy recovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmra2RYsGis86vmKKkn5bAbq7RqKuhnaJirqWw0Z6qrJ2jYrGwuM%2BhoKerXajBor7SZp2op6SXrq24jJ%2Bsra2imnqnu8ulprChnpx6tLHCqKWdZZOku6TB0qygqKZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
