Two years ago, Jamie was also selected as the trustee of her sister's estate, per the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-25/britney-spears-sister-makes-move-to-control-assets-as-trustee-of-her-pop-star-sisters-fortune data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Los Angeles Times</a>. Now, if approved, Britney's assets will be moved into one or more accounts with Fidelity Brokerage Services, which Jamie will oversee. In the event of Britney's death, Jamie will also be the one in charge of distributing her money to her children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The move follows news of Britney's lawyer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-08-18/britney-spears-conservatorship-jamie-spears data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reportedly telling courts" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">reportedly telling courts</a> that she is "strongly opposed" to the return of her father, James "Jamie" Spears, as the head of her conservatorship, which has been extended to 2021. Instead, she "strongly prefers" that her current stand-in conservator, Jodi Montgomery, be made permanent. Before taking a leave for health reasons, James had headed his daughter's conservatorship since its beginning in 2008.</p><img alt="nashville, tn november 02 actress jamie lynn spears attends the 50th annual cma awards at the bridgestone arena on november 2, 2016 in nashville, tennessee photo by taylor hillgetty images" title="The 50th Annual CMA Awards - Arrivals" width=2130 height=3194 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-623166030-1598453795.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Taylor Hill</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Jamie Lynn Spears attends the 50th annual CMA Awards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Recently, Britney's conservatorship came under more scrutiny by fans, sparking the #FreeBritney movement to go viral again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And her seemingly odd presence on social media further alarmed fans.

"Is that what actually happened? Are you okay Britney? Really worried about you," a user commented at the time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Britney eventually responded to fans' worries, reassuring them that she was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a33297439/britney-spears-social-media-statement/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="just being herself" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">just being herself</a>.
