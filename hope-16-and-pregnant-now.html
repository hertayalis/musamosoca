Before Teen Mom, there was 16 and Pregnant and to be honest, the latter walked so the former could run.

It was a sad story at first, of a teenage girl who was essentially left to fend for herself, pregnant alone. Naturally, both Ben and Hope were scared about having a baby together, but Ben’s initial reaction was strong and it had seemed like he wouldn't be able to come to terms with it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the end, Ben worked through his own feelings regarding Hope’s pregnancy and things seemed like they would work out, even with little help from Hope’s family. Since then, Ben and Hope both grew up and now, fans of the franchise are wondering what happened to Hope and how her story really turned out.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Hope from '16 and Pregnant' now?</h2><p>During a two-month period on 16 and Pregnant when Ben essentially abandoned Hope and her pregnancy, he partied as any average young person would. And, eventually, they tried to work things out. Since their time on the show, which aired in 2012, they grew even stronger as a couple. Ben and Hope are still together and, in addition to their son, they now have a daughter too.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>During 16 and Pregnant, Hope was a teenager without many options but with the expectation of going to college. Now, she is a real estate agent. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>her LinkedIn</u></a>, Hope has worked for a real estate company near Kansas City, Mo. since May 2020 and she and Ben seem to be doing well together as parents and as a couple. Where things could have gone totally differently, Hope definitely made the right choices for herself and her family.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">MTV revived '16 and Pregnant' in 2020.</h2><p>In 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>16 and Pregnant</u></a> went off the air. After five full seasons of young moms’ stories, the show had seemed to come to an abrupt end. Then, in 2020, MTV announced a revival of the series that started it all in the franchise. It meant a new chance for teenage moms to tell their stories and, according to MTV, it will also have personal video diary segments to give viewers a closer look at the moms on their journeys.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What ever happened to 'Teen Mom 3'?</h2><p>Even though fans are excited about the return of 16 and Pregnant, let’s not forget about the other Teen Mom show no one ever really talks about.
