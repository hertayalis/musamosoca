Later on in his life, Robertson wrote and performed music inspired by his First Nations family history — most notably in "Music for the Native Americans,"&nbsp;released in 1994 along with his Red Road Ensemble.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>By 1958, Robertson met future Band and Hawks musicians, including Ronnie Hawkins, Levon Helm, Rick Danko, and others. By the mid-1960s Robertson toured the world with Bob Dylan. Some of Robertson's most well-known work with The Band includes "Music from Big Pink," and The Band concert film and album "The Last Waltz." <a href=#>"The Last Waltz"</a>&nbsp;movie was directed by Martin Scorsese, and 2023's "Killers of the Flower Moon" was&nbsp;Robertson's fourteenth project with the director.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>As well as the American Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, in 1989 Robertson was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.&nbsp;According to <a href=#>The New Yorker</a>, Robertson's relationship with his former bandmate, Levon Helm — who died in 2012 — was acrimonious, and Robertson was blamed by some for the band's breakup.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Once Robertson's death was announced, songwriter Neil Diamond <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "The music world lost a great one with the passing of Robbie Robertson. Keep making that Beautiful Noise in the sky, Robbie. I'll miss you." Canadian musician Ron Sexsmith also <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "Unspeakably sad news. His songwriting and guitar playing made such a lasting impact on music and in fact changed the direction of music in the late 60's from psychedelic to a more roots based approach."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9km9pamplZL%2BwrsGinGaqn5eys8DSqKVmnJWWsW6Ej2aroZ1dl66vsI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
