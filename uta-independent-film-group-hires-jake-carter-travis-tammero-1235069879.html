Before that, he worked at Black Bear Pictures, and his résumé also includes stints at Sloss Eckhouse Dasti Haynes LawCo and FilmBuff (now Gunpowder & Sky).</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Tammero, who specializes in the sales of documentaries and series to studios, indie distributors and digital platforms, previously worked at CAA. During his time there, he was on teams representing filmmakers, financiers and producers like D.J. Caruso, Glen Zipper, Josh Zeman, Carmelo Anthony, Alex Winter, Jackie Chan and others. He also worked on 76 Days, Homeroom, Justin Bieber: Our World&nbsp;and WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn.</p><p>UTA’s co-president David Kramer said in a statement that he is “thrilled to welcome these highly regarded agents to our industry-leading independent film team,” with the unit responsible for content financing and distribution for independent and co-financed motion pictures. He continued by adding, “Their broad experience will augment the team in a variety of ways and is especially key in helping to expand our rapidly growing documentary business.”</p><p>They join at a critical time, too. The theatrical motion picture business remains in flux due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while there remains a high demand for indie dramas, documentaries and series in the streaming universe. Carter and Tammero also start the year on Meenaghan and Ronson’s team as they prep for this month’s Sundance Film Festival, one of the first major in-person markets to be held amid the ongoing pandemic.</p><p>UTA’s Independent Film Group has credits that include A Hero, Promising Young Woman, The Mauritanian, The Father, Hidden Figures, Room, Lady Bird, The Big Sick, Call Me by Your Name and I, Tonya, among others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmrqyRYravsMSpnKeclaPBbrLIpaRmn6KkwrF5x6Kpnqtdn66ssYycmKuslad6tb7Ar6CsZaSWuq6x0ahkampjan13hZdwcGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
