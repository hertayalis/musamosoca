Luckily for <a href=#>Daniel Tosh</a>, he had Carly Hallam on his team. In August 2020, it was announced that&nbsp;<a href=#>Tosh.0 would be ending&nbsp;</a>after its 12th season. Hallam was around for quite a few of those seasons as she joined&nbsp;Tosh.0 as a writer in 2012, according to <a href=#>People</a>. Prior to joining the writing team, Hallam appeared in several episodes of the viral clip show. And Hallam's not only credited for her work on Tosh.0,&nbsp;she also has writing <a href=#>credits</a> on NBC's <a href=#>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a>.</p><p>In addition to writing for television,&nbsp;Hallam also has published work on the internet.&nbsp;Her article about <a href=#>how to wear a little black dress</a> appears on a notorious satire site called McSweeney's.</p><p>Hallam and Tosh seem to share a similar sense of sarcastic humor. While her&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a> page is private, Hallam's&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a> page is public and exhibits some of her humorous commentary. In her pinned <a href=#>tweet</a>, she writes: "Would you like a printed receipt or would you like us to email you 3-5 times a week for the rest of your life?" It seems that Tosh has met his match made in comedy heaven. How romantic!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21kboF3e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5w5qlop2cYsGwv8esZLChlpp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
