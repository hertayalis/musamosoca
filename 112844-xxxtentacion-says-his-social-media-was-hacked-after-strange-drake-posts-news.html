Initially, there was a photo of man who looked like Drake performing fellatio. The post was taken down but X's Instagram story had another claim thats said Drake was trying to kill him.</p><p>"IF ANYONE TRIES TO KILL ME IT WAS @champagnepapi IM SNITCHING RN," he wrote.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/BfmtjJ5lutj</a><br></p><p>However, after all of these were deleted, he attempted to clear the air by saying he was hacked.</p><p>"Please stop entertaining that bullshit on Twitter, my accounts were previously hacked." He wrote on his IG story.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfm3oIYlVNn</a><br></p><p>Drake and XXXTENTACION's issues with each other seemed to be reignited after the video for "God's Plan" dropped and Drizzy challenged his followers to do a good deed for someone. Many took it as Drake stealing X's #HelpingHandChallenge. Regardless, both of them have denied that they have any problems with each other over that.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZn95gJNmr7GwpJq7ta3CoqanZaOWxrR5x6KqZqufmLaiuIymnJ2hkWLEor%2BMoZico5WZeqKy056pZqukp66vs8Rmm6uZm5p6sbvSrapmppWswA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
