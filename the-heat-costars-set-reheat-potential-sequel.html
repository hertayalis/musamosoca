Recommended Videos Bullock previously expressed her reluctance to reprise the role of Special Agent Sarah Ashburn in a second installment, likely due to her dubious track record with sequels (see: Speed 2: Cruise Control and Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

One would think that a film’s star publicly dismissing the idea of a follow-up would kill talk of a sequel, but it would seem that the conversation is not over yet.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Fox and The Heat director Paul Feig have announced plans to develop a sequel focusing on Beth (Jamie Denbo) and Gina (Jamie Chaffin),&nbsp;two foul-mouthed relatives of Det. Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy). The squirm-inducing duo, who turned Mullins’ uncomfortable homecoming into a stand-out scene, were a raunchy delight, as well as a highlight in a film brimming with great supporting performances.</p><p data-characters=54 data-current-count=54 data-injectable=false>On the subject of a Beth and Gina spin-off, Feig said:</p><p>Jamie and Jessica are two of the funniest people on this planet. They took small roles in&nbsp;The Heat&nbsp;and turned them into characters worthy of their own movie. I can’t wait to unleash Beth and Gina on the world. Run for your lives.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Could a stand-alone film centering exclusively upon these two loud-mouthed characters lead to box office gold? Feig and executives at Fox certainly seem to think so.&nbsp;I, for one, would welcome a&nbsp;film featuring these two, but a sequel to The Heat would surely suffer without Bullock’s services.</p><p>Tell us, do you think a sequel to<strong> The Heat</strong> (without the contributions of its main star) is a good idea?
