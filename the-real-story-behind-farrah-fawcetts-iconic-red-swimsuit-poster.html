Pitching the idea of featuring his client on a poster of her own, Hersh relayed the proposal to Fawcett,&nbsp;who, according to Scene, felt the idea was "cute" and agreed. As the actress stated in a 1977 interview with <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>, "The reason I decided to do a poster was, well, if you don't sign a deal to do one, somebody does one anyway, and then you get nothing." Her agreement came with certain terms, however. According to <a href=#>Biography</a>, Fawcett retained control over the images due to her displeasure with past experiences with certain photographers. This time around, Fawcett brought her own photographer to the shoot, freelancer Bruce McBroom.</p><p dir=ltr>The shoot for the new poster, held at&nbsp;Fawcett's Los Angeles mansion&nbsp;— which she owned with her then-husband Lee Majors&nbsp;— wasn't without its hitches. Pro Arts wanted the actress to wear a bikini and act seductive. Her reaction? As she told <a href=#>The Washington Post</a> in '77, "They wanted me in a bikini. I said no. Then they wanted me looking out from behind a tree, you know, acting seductive. I said, 'No, that's not me.' I wanted to be smiling. Happy." Due to some embarrassment over a childhood scar, the actress took to wearing one-piece bathing suits as a cover-up (via <a href=#>Biography</a>). Fawcett, of course, won out, ditching the bikini idea altogether and opting to go with several different one-piece suits for the shoot.</p><p dir=ltr><a href=# rel=sponsored class=norewrite>Buy this poster at Amazon for $12.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFlGtrcGxfqbWmedGemKVlo6m8s8WMm5yhoZ6Zeqet0auYoWWWlsSksdOtqmahk6S7qq%2BMq5ydZaOstq6%2F1KKrZqifqMGmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
