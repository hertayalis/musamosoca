On Christmas Eve, she posted a nine-minute long video singing about her followers’ hopes for 2021 to her own guitar accompaniment, and she ended the clip with a reprise of “Black Sheep,” the song that she performed in 2010 movie Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World.
Recommended Videos In this seriously underrated Edgar Wright film, Larson played Envy Adams, Scott Pilgrim’s ex-girlfriend and the lead singer of The Clash at Demonhead (which also boasts former Superman Brandon Routh on bass)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The World making only half of its $85 million budget back at the box office is one of cinema’s greatest injustices, as it’s an amazing film with a ton of awesome gags and shows off Wright’s many directorial talents. Since its release, it’s built up a sizeable cult following, receiving praise from cinema scholars for its incredible editing and transmedia narrative.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>This year’s tenth anniversary was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">set to be marked with a 4K remaster theatrical re-release</a>, but COVID-19 put an end to that. There was an online watch party featuring the cast and crew, though, during which they reminisced about the movie and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a retrospective article in Entertainment Weekly</a>, Wright commented that he was still “incredibly proud of the [film]. The fact that you’re not doing a 10th-anniversary article about <i>The Expendables</i> says it all.”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1920x1080_px_Scott_Pilgrim_Scott_Pilgrim_Vs_The_World-1017809.jpg alt="Scott Pilgrim vs. The World" width=1600 height=900 sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Fans of the flick have one more celebration left to come, too. There was a very well received video game tie-in that was removed from online storefronts in the early 2010s. But after years in the wilderness and a long fan campaign, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game is now being re-released on PC and consoles on January 14th, 2021.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, you can stream <strong>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World&nbsp;</strong>on Netflix and Prime Video, so give it a whirl.
