Someone also had to bring up the recent cricket scoreline as well, in classic Aussie vs&nbsp;Brit style.</p><p align=center>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately IDF was being dismantled around us after the 16 minute mark, so there is some background noise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The AnandTech Podcast - Episode 34</span><br><u>Featuring</u></p><ul><li>&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Ian Cutress, Host, Senior Editor (<a href=#>@IanCutress</a>)</li><li>&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Genevieve Bell, Special Guest, Senior Anthropologist and VP of the Corporate Strategy Group at Intel (<a href=#>@FeralData</a>)</li></ul><p><a href=#>iTunes</a><br>RSS -&nbsp;<a href=#>mp3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>m4a</a><br>Direct Links -&nbsp;<a href=#>mp3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>m4a</a></p><p><span>Total Time: 20m 39s</span></p><p>Many thanks to Dr Bell for her time – having been following her online thoughts for a time and finally getting a chance to sit and talk was an almost overwhelming experience. I subsequently forgot most of the questions I had mentally stored, perhaps dwelling on a couple of points with long winded questioning. I promise I’ll be better prepared next time!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZ2gZhop6ick5bAtXmSbWSinJZitq%2FAxKutop2nYsSqwMdmm6tll5q7psLInq2eZZKaua15yKernqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
