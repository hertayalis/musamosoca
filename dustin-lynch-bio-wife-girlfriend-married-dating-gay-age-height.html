He had joined the label of Valory Music Group.&nbsp;Lynch dropped her debut single “Cowboys and Angels” in January 2012, which immediately began streaming on Country Weekly’s Lifestyle website.&nbsp;The song would have earned her two nominations at the American Country Awards, while the video received a nomination at the CMT Music Awards for Percante Video of the Year.&nbsp;Dustin released his self-titled debut album in August 2012, to much acclaim.</span></p><p><span>“Where It’s At (Yep, Yep)” released in early 2014 became his first number one on Country Airplay.&nbsp;Later that year, he received an Academy of Country Music Award nomination for Best New Artist of the Year.&nbsp;His other notable songs include;&nbsp;“Hell of the Night,” “Mind Reader,” and “Little City Boy.”</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wife, Girlfriend, Married, Dating, Gay</span></strong></h2><p><span>Dustin Lynch, after rising to fame with his music, has long been an intimate person until 2017 when he started talking about his romantic life.&nbsp;Over time, he started sharing intimate snapshots of his life on social media, which sparked even more curiosity among his fans.</span></p><p><span>When Lynch gave next to nothing about his romantic life, many were forced to wonder if he might be gay, but according to his recent statements to the media, Dustin Lynch is far from a gay man and is as straight as it can be.&nbsp;Also, he has never been married before.</span></p><p><span>Lynch’s music often touches on themes of romance, intimacy and love, and in a September 2017 interview with People, he revealed that some of his song lyrics refer to real-life relationships he’s had, but he refrained from naming names.</span></p><p><span>Many eyebrows were raised in April 2017 when Kelly Osbourne took to her Instagram account to post a video of her and Lynch blowing out a candle on a slice of cake in honor of their “anniversary.”&nbsp;The legend was read;&nbsp;“With my @dustinlynchmusic boo # celebrating our one year anniversary!&nbsp;#The strange couple</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGicpajBqrqMpbCnm5hir6q7jLCgn51dnLazuMWroJ6mlGK6or7RopydZZSWwaq6xmaemrFdlrSmeceeoKCgpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
