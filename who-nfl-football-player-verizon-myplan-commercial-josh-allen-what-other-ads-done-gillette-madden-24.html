There, he can be seen in commercials for <a href=#>West Herr</a>, a Western New York-based auto dealership group, alongside Steve Tasker, Dion Dawkins, and Dawson Knox.</p><p dir=ltr>Allen has also signed many endorsement deals, including with New Era and <a href=#>Nike</a>. "It was a dream of mine to be a Nike athlete, seeing commercials of <a href=#>Kobe [Bryant]</a> and being a West Coast kid,"&nbsp;Allen said in the same Buffalo News piece. Other sponsorships, he admits, provide an opportunity to razz on another team's fanbase. In 2022, Allen became the new face of Gillette Razors — the company that secured the naming rights to the New England Patriots stadium in 2002. In a <a href=#>post-game interview</a>, Allen couldn't help but troll his division rival's fanbase.</p><p dir=ltr>"We're in Gillette Stadium," he said. "I'm a Gillette guy, so maybe I gotta clean up [my beard] a little bit." He continued, "I think people understand that, I kinda took that Gillette, you know it's a great sponsor to have, but I know where this stadium's at, right? I know who plays here. The fans here. Means a lot, means a lot."</p><p>Still, Allen's marketing career is about more than trolling. He serves as a spokesperson for the John R. Oishei Children's Hospital in Buffalo and regularly appears in ads to support fundraising. As part of his <a href=#>New Era</a> ambassadorship, he helped design a cap that benefitted the hospital.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvOqZyrZpOkunB9knFpa2toZMSpu4ynnaVllqS8ta7ApaNmqJyWxqa%2BjK%2Bcq6GqpLtuudipo5qmXZi8rrnEq5qimZxit7C%2Fx2aYpaSVo3q4tMCtZKismJq%2Fbq3DrGSdp56aeqi1y6WcrayVYrqisMOepWZqZGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
