We’re like we’re doing this, let’s play on this idea and start going again and yeah we’re here.”</p><p>The town’s theme is “Nautical by Nature,” as a way to show off the scenic views Iowa Falls has to offer. Organizers say they will be utilizing their entire community for camping, food and drink vendors, as well as entertainment.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>Take a look: Iowa’s first glow-in-the-dark bike trail now open</a><p>Burchfield says some of the challenges of planning this year included changes in RAGBRAI leadership, host towns not having housing committees, and not knowing exactly how many people will be coming to town. Still, Iowa Falls is grateful for the chance to welcome people from all over the country.</p><p>“Coming off the challenges that we in Iowa Falls, in Iowa, and as a world that we’ve faced with a global pandemic of this past year, this is just an opportune time to have an opportunity for economic recovery for our community,” Burchfield said. “So our community is really looking forward to that as well.”</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>Destination Iowa: WHO 13’s Roger Riley is on the ultimate Iowa road trip</a><p>Organizers are looking for more volunteers to help.
