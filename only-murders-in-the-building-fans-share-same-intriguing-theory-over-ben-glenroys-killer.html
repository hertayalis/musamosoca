Spoilers for the first three episodes ahead…</strong></p><p id=ejuN6djirw1 data-wc=56>After Ben collapsed during the production of Oliver Putnam's play Death Rattle, he was presumed dead, but the stage and screen actor made a brief comeback after being treated in hospital. But in true Only Murders style, a gory murder soon followed, and it was then revealed that Ben was later pushed down an elevator shaft.</p><p id=emgg_lgLV_ data-wc=11><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Only Murders in the Building: Martin Short's family life revealed</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eTlWMm8yTMT data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Bradley Cooper's appearance transformation in new movie Maestro receives backlash from fans – see why</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2540e3397a18-dickie-only-murders-in-the-building.jpg><p id=e0BCwRucdxs data-wc=44>So far,<strong>&nbsp;viewers seem to be in agreement that Dickie Glenroy (Jeremy Shamos) could be to blame</strong>. One person wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: "My theory so far is dickie did it. It would be too obvious if Loretta did it #onlymurdersinthebuilding."</p><p id=epj3dN-XG2d data-wc=53>A second agreed, adding: "My No.1 suspect is Dickie. He looks like he is in love with Loretta and might have got rid of Ben to free himself to be her manager." A third commented: "@OnlyMurdersHulu I'm going with the brother Dickie and the wife is going with Robert with a 'T' #OnlyMurdersInTheBuilding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d29957aab18-paul-rudd-as-ben-glenroy.jpg><p id=eiqujhF6Knm data-wc=47>A fourth fan also had Dickie at the top of their list, but mentioned some other names under suspicion too. "My list of suspects: Dickie Glenroy, Loretta, Kimber- Tobert Since the first season I also have doubts about Uma and Howard, I have no confidence in them."</p><p id=eK6u0QEeBCy data-wc=30>Another shared their brilliant theory: "Here's an out-there #OnlyMurdersInTheBuilding theory: what if the two attempts on Ben's life were committed by two different people, potentially with unrelated motives? #OMITB #WhoKilledBenGlenroy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/407cc6572e71-martin-short-in-only-murders-in-the-building.jpg><p id=eF4maHK4bbQ data-wc=41>Viewers are introduced to Dickie in episode one when we meet Ben Glenroy for the first time. Dickie is Ben's brother and manager who has a hard time dealing with his brother's demanding and diva-like behavior. Could this be a motive?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cb8197720fcf-ashley-park-omitb.jpg><p id=e0eCUlYG0yx data-wc=82>Meanwhile, in the first three episodes, many threads for what happened have been weaved. At the end of the most recent episode, it was Kimber, played by Ashley Park, who was portrayed as a potential suspect behind the murder of Ben when she admitted to Charles (Martin Short) that she was no longer in possession of her handkerchief – leading Charles to believe it could have been hers that Ben was holding when his dead body was found.
