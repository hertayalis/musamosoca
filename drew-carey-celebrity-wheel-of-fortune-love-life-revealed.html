While details about the couple’s relationship remain undisclosed, the two reportedly met in the mid-2000s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/18180fb145dd-drew-nicole-z.jpg><p id=eDZb-O-vXoMQ data-wc=7><strong>Drew proposed to girlfriend Nicole in 2007</strong></p><p id=e4bAiiQAVvj4 data-wc=52>However, the two never made it down the aisle as Drew and Nicole amicably ended their engagement in 2012. Drew’s representatives told People at the time: “He and Nicole still have a great deal of love and affection for one another,” adding: “He will still be very involved with their son’s life.”</p><p id=esV2LLAvTMWc data-wc=36>Drew remains close to both Nicole and her son from a previous relationship, Connor even today.

I thought, I’m never going to see him graduate high school.” Thanks to Connor, Drew shed over 100 pounds.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Engagement to Amie Harwick</h2><p id=eW_D_hMVI2-V data-wc=43>Six years after ending his relationship with Nicole, Drew popped the question again, this time to licensed marriage and family therapist, Amie Harwick. The pair reportedly hit it off after meeting at a party in 2017 and got engaged a few months later.</p><p id=eus7GgUiP5Fn data-wc=34>The couple regularly stepped out on the red carpet together and piled on the PDA on social media but sadly it wasn’t meant to be and the couple ended their engagement in November 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/006c83321413-drew-amie-z.jpg><p id=eYN2yJqUmZvE data-wc=12><strong>Drew became engaged for a second time in 2017 to girlfriend Amie</strong></p><p id=e0COhZELprD4 data-wc=32><strong>The two remained close friends up until Amie’s death&nbsp;in 2020</strong>. The 38-year-old was found at her Hollywood Hills home after being attacked by ex-boyfriend Gareth Pursehouse in February of last year.</p><p id=eok30zFb6Sdy data-wc=60>When Drew learnt of the news of Amie’s tragic death he withdrew from filming for The Price is Right for a week and took to Twitter to pay tribute to his late ex-fiance. He shared a photo of the two alongside the message: “<strong>Hope you’re lucky enough to have someone in your life that loves as much as she did.”</strong></p><p id=e5maPfyj8FbI data-wc=77>"Amie and I had a love that people are lucky to have once in a lifetime," Carey said in a statement to CNN. "She was a positive force in the world, a tireless and unapologetic champion for women, and passionate about her work as a therapist. <strong>I am overcome with grief. I</strong> would like to thank you in advance for giving myself and everyone who loved Amie privacy while we try to work through this tragic situation."</p><p id=eBYfqQp8epf6 data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2tpYGZ%2Bd32PbW5ubl%2BZv6bDjJyYq52pYrCmuMSbqaKsqWLEqbHEpWSonl2bvLPA1KecZqSfq7JuuMifnGaqlauyorjEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
