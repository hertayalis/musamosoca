There’s one big twist, though, and it has to do with the protagonist.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>As the game’s title suggests,&nbsp;Spider-Man: Miles Morales will not center on Peter Parker, but his friend Miles. A familiar face in the friendly neighborhood hero’s comic book mythos, Miles was a supporting character in the original game, one that players could control only during a select number of stealth sections.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EaRCFgBWsAE6GBx.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EaRCHWiX0AE3duI.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EaRCDusXkAIAiHB.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EaRCCKOXYAAlBDU.jpeg><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>This time around, he’s been given a bigger role. Similar to the insanely popular&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&nbsp;animated film, Miles is a young New Yorker who’s still getting used to being a vigilante. Whether the video game iteration of this enthusiastic teen will require Peter to teach him the ropes as well remains to be seen, though.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>Following the example of rival studio Rocksteady’s&nbsp;Batman: Arkham&nbsp;franchise, Insomniac was able to create a Spider-Man game that didn’t just appeal to diehard fans of the character, but pretty much anyone who owned a gaming console. Through a combination of smoothly-flowing yet challenging combat, and incredibly satisfying web-slinging, the studio was able to truly make players feel what it’s like to be Spider-Man.</p><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=117 data-injectable=false>Tell us, though, are you excited to see more of <strong>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong>?
