As for the boys' father, there is no information available on him. Caleb and Cody also have an older brother named Raheem.</p><p>Raheem, Caleb, and Cody were brought up in a 300-square-foot trailer in Cooleemee, N.C., a town with a population of just over 900, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reno Gazette Journal</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jenny worked three jobs, including a scan analyst position at the grocery store Food Lion. She woke up at 2 a.m. every morning and tried to be home by 3 p.m. to be with her sons after school. To make sure there was enough food on the table for her children, she sometimes went without eating.</p><p>Jenny first got pregnant with Raheem as a teen and was kicked out of her family's house. Two and a half years later, she welcomed Caleb and Cody.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The environments she raised her boys in weren't always ideal. In fact, Caleb claimed that he and his brothers saw drug deals and shootings at one apartment complex they lived in.</p><p>However, the boys knew she was trying her absolute best and couldn't be more grateful. "I know it might sound cliché and corny, but she’s our hero," Caleb told the outlet.</p><p>He added: "Cody and I will reminisce about our childhood and we now notice all of the stuff she didn’t let us in on when we were little, all of the stuff we realize now. It was hard, but she made a lot of sacrifices like not eating certain nights and passing up job opportunities because she had no help at home and had to be there for us.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Caleb and Cody, who played college basketball for two seasons at North Carolina State, later transferred to the University of Nevada after receiving full-ride scholarships with the Nevada Wolf Pack.
