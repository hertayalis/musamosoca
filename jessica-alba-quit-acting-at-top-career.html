The actress and entrepreneur attributes her change in career to the switch of mindset she had following the birth of her daughter Honor in 2008.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My mother had cancer at a really young age, in her early 20s. I grew up with chronic illness. I had five surgeries before I was 11 years old. I had chronic allergies, and I was hospitalized a lot as a child," she said in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Romper</a><strong>.</strong> "I had this real moment of, I want to live, and thrive, and spend as much time with this little person that I'm bringing into the world as possible and stay. So, my health matters. I want this little person to be healthy. And it's really freaking hard to be happy when you don't have your health."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She shared that it was never out of fear or insecurity that she wouldn't receive more acting jobs. "Frankly, I was at the top of my career," said Alba. "I couldn't go back to what I was doing before and be authentic. I just couldn't. I didn't care about it the same way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She has since had two more kids, daughter Haven, 9, and son Hayes, 3, and said becoming a mother made her strive to do "something bigger."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I felt like if I was going to have this platform, then what can I do with it that could be meaningful and make a difference?" she said. "That just felt so real when I became a mom for the first time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2012, Alba launched <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Honest Company</a>, which specializes in natural baby, cleaning, and beauty products. And while the company has since taken off (selling with retail giants like Target), it wasn't always so easy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Building a brand and building a business is f—king impossible," she said. "And to be good at it and for it to thrive and scale, it is really hard. If anything, I was like, 'Do I really want to do this?' In every stage, I'm trying to get better and better as a business person, but it's a totally different skill set than just taking your influence and fame and putting your name on a package and doing a press tour, picking out a couple designs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She has since dabbled in other acting gigs, including the short-lived series L.A.'s Finest — a spinoff of the Bad Boys franchise — alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gabrielle Union</a>. But Alba is a woman of many talents and we're just excited to see what she takes on next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8meqqyhk5Z6orjBmmajnaOotqStjJqjm5ldpsKqwIyamq2hnpx6osCMraapZZOWv6ax0Q%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
