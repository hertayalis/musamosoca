It may have something to do with his clean-cut lifestyle. For starters, the "Gilmore Girls" alum has been a lifelong vegetarian, and credits his upbringing for keeping his diet meat-free. "I was a vegetarian in the womb, I was doing it before it was a trend," he said during an interview on "<a href=#>The Bonnie Hunt Show</a>," adding that he was raised vegetarian alongside his two sisters — and even their family dog — thanks to his parents who had been meat-free for 40 years.</p><p>In 2009, the actor even garnered himself the well-earned mantle of <a href=#>PETA</a>'s sexiest vegetarian — a title that he can likely still claim with pride to this day, let's be real. On top of swerving animal products, Ventimiglia also doesn't drink alcohol and hasn't since the start of his career, telling the <a href=#>Mail Online</a>, "I gave up alcohol at 22 when it started to get in the way."</p><p>However, the decision to abstain from hooch was hardly a big deal for the actor who admitted to the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> that much like meat, alcohol "never factored into my life." He explained, "My parents didn't drink, and it was never anything I was raised around." These lifestyle choices look great on the guy, honestly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb25kZYJ0e9ahmK1lqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWdnrmwedWepa2hnZ60rbXAaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
